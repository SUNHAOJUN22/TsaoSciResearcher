# AspenOps v2 Optimization Engine

## Design objective

The optimizer is budgeted, constraint-aware and batch-oriented. It does not
allow an evolutionary or learning loop to invoke Aspen without an explicit
maximum evaluation count, Worker cap and simulator timeout.

## Problem model

An optimization document declares:

- semantic variables;
- variable kinds: continuous, integer, categorical, ordinal;
- one or more objectives;
- objective direction: minimize or maximize;
- optional scalar weights used by the search algorithm;
- process constraints and conservation checks in the normal batch request;
- population, generation, mutation, crossover and evaluation budget;
- deterministic seed and optional checkpoint path.

Categorical and ordinal variables are encoded as bounded indexes and decoded
before semantic writes are generated. Integer variables are rounded within
their declared bounds.

## Batch differential evolution

The implemented search is bounded `DE/rand/1/bin` with Deb-style feasibility
ordering. The initial population and every generation are submitted with one
`evaluate_many` call:

```text
initial population -> one Aspen batch
generation 1 trials -> one Aspen batch
...
generation G trials -> one Aspen batch
```

This allows the persistent CasePool to use all licensed Workers and prevents a
serial Python optimizer from leaving simulator instances idle.

## Dimensionless scalarization contract

A single objective may retain its native engineering unit. Multi-objective
weighted scalarization is fail-closed unless every objective declares `unit`,
`dimension`, `reference_value`, and a finite positive `reference_scale`. The
optimizer then computes

```text
z_i = sign_i * (f_i - f_ref,i) / f_scale,i
J = sum_i weight_i * z_i
```

so each `z_i` and the combined score `J` are dimensionless. Equivalent unit
representations, such as kW and W, must transform the value, reference, and
scale together and therefore cannot change candidate ordering. Raw
heterogeneous values are still retained for reporting and Pareto dominance,
but they are never added directly.

## Feasibility ordering

For scalar candidates:

1. feasible dominates infeasible;
2. between feasible candidates, lower minimized scalar objective wins;
3. between infeasible candidates, lower aggregate violation wins.

Transport and convergence failures receive finite but severe violation values.
They remain sortable without becoming competitive with physically valid points.

## Multi-objective results

Original objective values are retained for reporting. Maximization objectives
are sign-normalized only for internal minimization. The result includes a
non-dominated Pareto archive evaluated under feasibility-first dominance.

For one objective the archive is extracted with a linear minimum filter. For
two objectives AspenOps uses an exact stable sweep with `O(n log n)` sorting and
linear scanning. Higher-dimensional objective sets retain exact incremental
dominance filtering. These paths preserve input ordering and duplicate-removal
semantics while avoiding unnecessary pairwise work in the common one- and
two-objective cases.

The scalar weighted score guides the current DE search; it is not presented as
a universal replacement for Pareto decision analysis.

## Checkpointing

An optional checkpoint is written atomically after the initial population and
each completed generation. It contains generation number, evaluation count and
population state. Checkpoint persistence does not imply that a proprietary
simulator call itself is replay-free.

## Interfaces

- CLI: `aspenops optimize request.json`
- MCP: `submit_optimization`, `optimization_status`,
  `optimization_result`, `cancel_optimization`
- Python: `run_optimization_document`

Durable optimization jobs use the same leased Scheduler, cancellation deadlines
and PoolManager as batch simulations.

## Qualification

Mock optimization results are labelled `control-plane-only`. A real Aspen
optimization remains `PENDING_REAL_ASPEN_CERTIFICATION` until candidate points,
constraints, property method and final optima are independently reviewed and
repeated on an approved licensed model.
